      "Artemis I, formerly Exploration Mission-1,will be the first integrated flight test of NASA’s Deep Space Exploration Systems: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with the newly upgraded Exploration Ground Systems at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The primary operations goal of the mission is to assure a safe crew module entry, descent, splashdown, and recovery. In addition to sending Orion on its journey around the Moon, SLS will carry 10 small satellites that will perform their own science and technology investigations. The first in a series of increasingly complex missions, Artemis I will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond prior to the first flight with crew on Artemis II. Artemis I is foundational to the space economy, fueling new industries and technologies, supporting job growth, and furthering the demand for a highly skilled work force. Men and women in all fifty states are hard at work building the Deep Space Exploration Systems to support missions to deep space. NASA prime contractors, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Boeing, Jacobs, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman currently have over 3,200 suppliers contributing to the milestone achievement that heralds the success of America’s human spaceflight program.",

DART is aiming for the binary asteroid Didymos, which is made up of the bigger Didymos and the smaller Dimorphos. Dimorphos is orbiting Didymos, and it will crash with the DART satellite. Dimorphos' speed is anticipated to be altered by the impact by a little percentage. Dimorphos's orbit around Didymos will be significantly impacted by this tiny speed shift, which will also further scientific knowledge on the use of kinetic impact to divert asteroids. The DART mission represents a significant advance in planetary protection. It is the first time that a spacecraft has been directed to strike an asteroid on purpose.
